# GIF Search App 🔍✨

A modern, responsive, and modular web application built with **Vanilla JavaScript (ES6+)** that connects to the **Giphy API** to search and display GIFs. This project is created as part of **The Odin Project** curriculum ("Working With APIs").

It is structured following software design patterns like the **Single Responsibility Principle (SOLID)** and uses **Webpack** as its build tool and asset bundler, alongside **ESLint** for code quality assurance.

## 🚀 Key Features

*   **Architecture (Orchestrator Pattern):** Clean separation of concerns. The API fetching logic and DOM rendering are completely decoupled. They communicate exclusively through a central orchestrator (`index.js`).
*   **Giphy API Integration:** Implements robust asynchronous data fetching using `async/await` and custom error handling for network or HTTP status failures.
*   **Dynamic UI & Component Rendering:** Native DOM building (without innerHTML vulnerability risks where dynamic data is injected), featuring a single-column layout for single GIFs and a clean 3-column responsive grid layout for search results.
*   **Webpack Multi-Environment Build:** Divided into `common`, `development` (with a local dev server at port 3000, hot reloading, and source mapping), and `production` (optimized for deployment).
*   **Environment Variables Support:** Uses `dotenv-webpack` to securely manage API keys without leaking them into version control.
*   **Advanced Linting Layout:** Configured with the modern ESLint flat system (`eslint.config.js`) supporting JavaScript, JSON, CSS, and Markdown linting rules.

## 🛠️ Installation & Setup Guide

### 1. Prerequisite Environment
Ensure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed on your computer.

### 2. Clone and Jump In
```bash
git clone https://github.com/alfredo-alt/search_app_alf.git
cd search_app_alf
```

### 3. Install Dependencies
Pull down all loaders, plugins, and development tools declared in `package.json`:
```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Inject Environment Variables
The application queries Giphy using an API key loaded through `process.env.GIPHY_API_KEY`. 
1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory.
2. Add your Giphy API key:
```env
GIPHY_API_KEY=dc6zaTOxFJmzC
```
*(Note: The key above is Giphy's public beta testing key, which is excellent for learning environments but rate-limited).*

## 📦 Lifecycle Scripts

Manage your runtime and build outputs with these commands:

*   **Run Local Development Server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```
    Compiles assets in-memory, stands up a server at `http://localhost:3000`, watches files for code changes, and auto-opens your default web browser.

*   **Build for Production Compilation:**
    ```bash
    npm run build
    ```
    Aggregates, compiles, and uglifies assets inside a clean, distribution-ready `/dist` folder.

*   **Deploy Output:**
    ```bash
    npm run deploy
    ```
    Pushes your built distribution folder to the `gh-pages` branch for hosting.

## 🧩 Structural Architectural Walkthrough

### 🛰️ Data Engine (`src/modules/apiService.js`)
Strictly isolated from the visual layer. It exposes two core actions: `fetchRandomGif()` and `searchGifs(query)`. If an HTTP error occurs (e.g., status 404 or 500), it explicitly intercepts the response state and throws a verbose error instance so that handlers upper-stream can properly process the anomaly.

### 🎨 Graphic UI Builder (`src/modules/domController.js`)
Operates under Dependency Inversion; it does not import the API layers. It takes raw incoming properties and callback arrays to render layout blocks seamlessly. Contains distinct layout mechanisms to draw full-scale static highlights or multiple collection nodes inside a dynamic `3-column CSS Grid`.

### 🧠 App Conductor (`src/index.js`)
Imports both structural nodes. Hooks the functional visual callbacks up to async data streams. Manages sequential user triggers like executing a random preview lookup when the page first instances.
